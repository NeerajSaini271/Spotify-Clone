## Responsive / Styling Notes
- Layout uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for main player and playlists
- Breakpoints implemented for tablets and mobile screens
- Images and player elements scale fluidly (`max-width: 100%` and `height: auto`)
- Text sizes use relative units (`rem` / `clamp()`) for better readability on smaller devices

## Roadmap / Future Improvements
- Add track search and dynamic playlist filtering
- Implement more interactive UI elements (volume control, progress bar)
- Enhance accessibility with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- Optional: Integrate a backend for real audio streaming
